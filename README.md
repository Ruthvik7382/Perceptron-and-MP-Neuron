# Perceptron-and-MP-Neuron
This code gives a introduction algorithms for Deep Learning.
Data Preparation: Utilizes the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets. It involves loading the dataset, preprocessing, and exploring data features and target classes.

Binarization of Data: Demonstrates binarization techniques applied to the dataset, preparing it for the MP Neuron model.

MP Neuron Model Implementation: Illustrates the creation and testing of an MP Neuron model, including finding the optimal threshold value (b) for the model.

Perceptron Model Implementation: Shows the implementation of a Perceptron model, covering its training process with adjustable epochs and learning rate, weight adjustments, and accuracy tracking.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates both models using accuracy metrics, illustrating the performance of these foundational neural network models on the dataset.

Visualizations: Includes plots and visualizations for data exploration and model evaluation.
